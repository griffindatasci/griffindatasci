#### Rob Griffin

Data scientist and statistical programmer with experience in academic research (evolutionary biology) and the pharmaceutical industry.

Following a PhD in Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics (Uppsala University, 2015), I held Postdoc positions in Finland, Sweden and Australia. In 2020, I took the decision to leave academia due to the impacts on family life, and pursue a career in data science, programming, statistics and research. My first step on this path was joining the AstraZeneca Biometrics Graduate Program, a program I was promoted from one year early. 

I am now **actively job searching** for roles that allow me to call on experience in research to use my skills in data analysis, visualisation and communication.
