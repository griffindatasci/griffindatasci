## Looking for work!

I am now **actively job searching** for roles in data science or programming more generally. I have extensive experience in statistical analysis and statistical programming in R and SAS, and taking research projects from design and implementation through to analysis and communication, but love learning new technical skills &mdash; I have recently taken courses in my free time on Python, SQL, Java and Kotlin! My ideal role would call on my tendency to seek innovative solutions through critical thinking and creativity, an ability to simplify complexity, and provide the opportunity for development and learning. 


## Rob Griffin

**Data scientist and statistical programmer with experience in academic research and the pharmaceutical industry.**

Following a PhD in Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics (Uppsala University, 2015), I held Postdoc positions in Finland, Sweden and Australia. In 2020, I took the decision to leave academia due to the impacts on family life, and pursue a career in data science, programming, statistics and research. My first step on this path was joining the AstraZeneca Biometrics Graduate Program, a program I was promoted from one year early. 

I have a strong interest in research and data that extend beyond my work into personal settings and projects. Personal use of data cover a variety of topics but most often incorporate my interest in cycling. I am an avid cyclist and use the [Zwift](https://eu.zwift.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=zwift_eur_eu_cycling_search_brandcoreex_performance_eng-imprshare-21&gclid=Cj0KCQiAmaibBhCAARIsAKUlaKRZ8AabuV9v-UHyhj_SZ6x1DyZCI-0IFBGwt5NkHOTsqOXFYstUJ50aArRQEALw_wcB) racing/training/gaming platform &mdash; a computer game connected to an indoor trainer measuring power output, allowing the user to [ride, train and race](https://www.youtube.com/live/Q3ss9m7YyFI?feature=share&t=1900) in a collection of virtual worlds.
