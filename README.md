## Looking for work!

I am now **actively job searching** for roles in **data science, data engineering or programming** more generally. I have extensive experience in statistical analysis and statistical programming in **R, SQL and SAS**, and taking research projects from design and implementation through to analysis and communication, but love improving and adding new technical skills &mdash; I have recently taken courses in my free time on **Python, SQL, Java and Kotlin** programming and tools including **PowerBI and Databricks**! My ideal role would encourage the pursuit of innovative solutions through **critical thinking and creativity**, an ability to simplify complexity, and provide the opportunity for development and learning &mdash; **I'm more than happy to try my hand in a new area of programming**! 


## Rob Griffin

**Data scientist and statistical programmer with experience in academic research and the pharmaceutical industry.**

Following a PhD in Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics (Uppsala University, 2015), I held Postdoc positions in Finland, Sweden and Australia. In 2020, I took the decision to leave academia due to the impacts on family life, and pursue a career in data science, programming, statistics and research. My first step on this path was joining the AstraZeneca Biometrics Graduate Program, a program I was promoted from one year early. 

My interests in research and data that extend beyond my work into personal settings and projects. Personal use of data cover a variety of topics but most often incorporate my interest in cycling. I love cycling, riding several times a week, both on the road and in the virtual world of Zwift &mdash; [check out my race livestreams!](https://www.youtube.com/live/Q3ss9m7YyFI?feature=share&t=1900)
