#### Rob Griffin

Data scientist and statistical programmer with experience in academic research (evolutionary biology) and the pharmaceutical industry.

Following a PhD in Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics (Uppsala University, 2015), I held Postdoc positions in Finland, Sweden and Australia. In 2020, I took the decision to leave academia due to the impacts on family life, and pursue a career in data science, programming, statistics and research. My first step on this path was joining the AstraZeneca Biometrics Graduate Program, a program I was promoted from one year early. 

I am now **actively job searching** for roles that allow me to call on experience in research to use my skills in data analysis, visualisation and communication.

I have a strong interest in research and like to use data to provide insight in personal projects. Projects here are naturally impacted by personal interests, chief among which is cycling. I am an avid cyclist and use the [Zwift](https://eu.zwift.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=zwift_eur_eu_cycling_search_brandcoreex_performance_eng-imprshare-21&gclid=Cj0KCQiAmaibBhCAARIsAKUlaKRZ8AabuV9v-UHyhj_SZ6x1DyZCI-0IFBGwt5NkHOTsqOXFYstUJ50aArRQEALw_wcB) racing/training/gaming platform - a computer game connected to an indoor trainer measuring power output, allowing the user to ride, train and race in a collection of virtual worlds.
